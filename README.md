 ## How to use
 
### The .exe file requires `Java JDK` to run

Preferably version 10, as it's the last version with JavaFX built in.

<br>

* After downloading it, run `setup.ps1` and provide path for your JDK root folder.
* Make sure `words` folder is in the same directory as game.

<br>

* **Launch:**
  * Just double click on `.exe` file or:
  * `java -jar imspeed.jar` - setting system environment variables (setup.ps1) is not required when using .jar
  
`.exe` file is in fact wrapped jar, allowing for the icon and to run the program with a simple double-click
